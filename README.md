# KongligSK
Separation kernel for RISC-V targeting secure embedded processors (M+U-mode and PMP). This is a playground for features, designs, and build system that may be included in [OpenMZ](https://github.com/castor-software/openmz). 

*Projected completion date 2025.*

## Kernel goals

### Formal verification 
A separation kernel should be completely verified. We will verify it in two stages.

- We formally verify the C code with respect to a formal model of the kernel and the RISC-V specification. This allows us to compile the kernel with formally verified compiler [CompCert](https://github.com/AbsInt/CompCert), and get a fully formally verified kernel.

- We formally verify the kernel binary using [HolBA](https://github.com/kth-step/HolBA), allowing us to use any compiler and thus get better optimization.

### Security
A separation kernel secures processes with spatial and temporal isolation.

### Performance 
Fast context switches and IPC calls are essential for a separation kernel.

### Size 
A small footprint is essential for both performance and embedded systems.

### Extensible
RISC-V has a lot of extensions (official and custom), so the kernel should be comfortably extensible.

### Real-time properties 
RT properties makes the kernel suitable for some RT applications.

## API
WIP.

## Installation
