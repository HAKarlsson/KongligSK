# KongligSK
KongligSK (~Royal Separation Kernel) is a separation kernel for RISC-V targeting secure embedded processors (M+U-mode and PMP). KongligSK is a research kernel for features, designs, and build system that may be included in [OpenMZ](https://github.com/castor-software/openmz). 

*Projected completion date 2025.*

## Kernel goals

- **Formal Verification.** A separation kernel should be completely verified. We consider two approaches to the verification.

    - We formally verify the C code with respect to a formal model of the kernel and the RISC-V specification. This allows us to compile the kernel with formally verified compiler [CompCert](https://github.com/AbsInt/CompCert), and get a fully formally verified kernel.

    - We formally verify the kernel binary using [HolBA](https://github.com/kth-step/HolBA), allowing us to use any compiler and thus get better optimization.

- **Security.** A separation kernel should secures processes with spatial and temporal isolation.

- **Performance.** Fast context switches and IPC calls are essential for a separation kernel.

- **Small footprint.** A small footprint is important for most embedded systems.

- **Extensible.** RISC-V has a lot of extensions (official and custom), these extension can invalidate the kernel verification. We want to synthesize kernel code that extends the kernel functionality and verification.

- **Real-time properties.** RT properties makes the kernel suitable for some RT applications. Exact properties TBD.

## API
TBD.

## Installation
TBD.

## TODO

1. Determine the API of the kernel.

2. Benchmark the kernel using gcc and compcert on HiFive1 rev. B. This will determine whether we should formally verify the kernel source code or binary. If the gcc version gives us a kernel with considerably better performance, we will verify the kernel binary.

3. Write a pen and paper model and proof of the kernel.

4. Create a formal model of the kernel in [HOL](https://hol-theorem-prover.org/).

5. ???
